# GetInstagramUserInformation
Get instagram user information by pyhton
i do create this part of code using by `beauty soap and bs4 library` .

Here you have a base Simple Model at https://masterprograming.com/get-instagram-account-details-in-python/

but i do a bit changes inside to getting username from user and send to our function , also controling program with try except to ask new username from user otherwise exit from the application.

it was good to have practise on functions and try except in python programming.

you must install libraryes with PIP3 not simple Pip

to installation of that :
First open terminal for mac :  "``Ctrl+`" and for windows : "`Ctrl+``"

`pip3 install bs4`
`pip3 install beautysoap`

and after that try to codding.



hope it be helpful for begginners .
